# Tasks for [FEATURE]

Note: Tasks should follow TDD. Prefer contracts/integration tests first, then implementation. Mark independent tasks with [P] for parallel.

1. [P] Create contracts: define API schema and write failing contract tests
2. [P] Define data model: entities, validation rules, relationships
3. Setup quickstart: document how to run tests and smoke the feature
4. [P] Implement minimal server stubs to satisfy contract tests
5. Implement services to pass integration tests
6. Implement UI components/pages with accessibility and i18n
7. Add structured logging and error context
8. Add performance budget checks if applicable
9. Update docs and changelog
10. Add E2E smoke (optional if small)
